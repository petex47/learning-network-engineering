# Learning network engineering
Hey there!
I've just kicked off a new GitHub repository named Learning Network Engineering. I'm sharing my journey of diving into network engineering from scratch. I'm a complete beginner in this field, and I'm documenting my learning process. Join me as I navigate through GitHub and learn the ropes!

## What the project does
_**Learning network engineering**_ is a documentation project that shows me how to document projects and tasks. Since I have zero experience in tech, this is my way of figuring out how to navigate Github and, over time, properly document small to more significant projects.

As time passes, I will upload files and links to my learnings here (Github) and on Instagram Reels daily to show my progress.

I hope other beginners find this helpful or inspiring to begin their journey!

## If you'd like to support my learning journey, you can do so here! 
My goal is to break into tech and transition from a line cook to a network engineer to provide for my family. Tech certifications are expensive and hard to pay for on a line cooks salary, so if you'd like to help, you can do so here!
